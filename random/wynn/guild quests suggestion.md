# Guild Quests

So, this aims to answer a few questions. 

1. What is a guild quest and why do we need it?
2. How do these differ from normal quests?
3. How would these types of quests work?

### What is a guild quest?

Guild quests allow you and your guild to do different things around the world and provide a better reason for community focused guilds. There are 2 types of guild quests: **community goals and community quests**. Community goals are bassiclly objectives similar to the per player ones that already exist, exept these are more focus on guilds. More on this later. Community quests are synchronous (multiple people required) and asynchronous (one person can do this) quests, with sync and async parts combining different quest stages. These types of quests allow people with different timezones to participate, while still allowing big gatherings of people. These are ment to be *extentions of the lore*, there *not meant to create new lore*.

### How do these differ from normal quests?

As I said above, there not meant to add more lore, unlike most high level quests. You still can learn more lore though - they just won't bring in a ton of new info. They also will require participation from many people within the guild.

### How would they work?

#### Community Goals

Bassiclly another section in `/gu manage`, this would allow you to see progress on goals. Gaosl rotate every week, and guilds get 7 to choose from. You can only choose 3 "goals" to track at a time.
